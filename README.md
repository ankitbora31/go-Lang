# Introduction
- Basic programs in go (Go starters)


##  :beginner: About
Go, also known as Golang, is an open-source, compiled, and statically typed programming language designed by Google. 
It is built to be simple, high-performing, readable, and efficient.

## :zap: Usage
- Concurrency thrives in any networking environment. Using goroutines and channels, Go is naturally suited for developing network services such as APIs, web servers, and mini frameworks for web applications. 
- The same concurrency and networking features align with its high portability across various platforms make Go an exceptional language for cloud computing. As a matter of fact, many stand-out cloud platforms like Kubernetes were built with Go. Google Cloud also uses Go to enhance scalability and performance. 
- Many old infrastructures were rewritten using Go in an attempt to modernize what’s become obsolete over time. A new version of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) – an internet protocol for clock synchronization among networks – relies on Go. 
- Since Go is fully functional with little to no dependencies, the language is well-suited for building small tooling items. These can launch quickly and be packaged for redistribution at a moment’s notice. 
- The busy bustle of everyday life requires technology that can accommodate the everyday person who needs fast and reliable service. The best example of a service like this is Uber which uses Go to get to users in the nick of time for just about every request. 

###  :electric_plug: Installation
- Download the Golang according to your system architecture from https://golang.org/dl/
- After downloading, unzip the downloaded archive file. After unzipping you will get a folder named go in the current directory.
- Now copy and paste the extracted folder wherever you want to install this.
- Open environment variables and then
- Click on Path from the system variables and then click Edit. Then Click New and then add the Path with bin directory where you have pasted the Go folder.
- Open terminal and type "go --version" to check if it is correctly installed.


### :notebook: Pre-Requisites
- System knowledge
